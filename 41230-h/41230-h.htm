<img class="figleft" src="images/i009b.jpg" width="50" height="60" alt="T" />
<br />he poets have ever been lovers of
books; indeed, one might ask how
should a man be a poet who did
not admire a treasure as precious
and as beautiful as a book may be.
With evident enjoyment, Keats describes</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A viol, bowstrings torn, cross-wise upon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A glorious folio of Anacreon;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and it was a glorious folio of Beaumont and Fletcher
which another English poet (whose most poetic work
was done in prose) "dragged home late at night from
Barker's in Covent Garden," and to pacify his conscience
for the purchase of which he kept to his overworn
suit of clothes for four or five weeks longer
than he ought. Charles Lamb was a true bibliophile,
in the earlier and more exact sense of the term; he
loved his ragged volumes as he loved his fellow-men,
and he was as intolerant of books that are not books
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
as he was of men who were not manly. He conferred
the dukedom of his library on Coleridge, who
was no respecter of books, though he could not but
enrich them with his marginal notes. Southey and
Lord Houghton and Mr. Locker are English poets
with libraries of their own, more orderly and far
richer than the fortuitous congregation of printed
atoms, a mere medley of unrelated tomes, which often
masquerades as The Library in the mansions of the
noble and the wealthy. Shelley said that he thought
Southey had a secret in every one of his books which
he was afraid the stranger might discover: but this
was probably no more, and no other, than the secret
of comfort, consolation, refreshment, and happiness
to be found in any library by him who shall
bring with him the golden key that unlocks its silent
door.</p>

<p>Mr. Lowell has recently dwelt on the difference
between literature and books: and, accepting this
distinction, the editor desires to declare at once that
as a whole this collection is devoted rather to books
than to literature. The poems in the following pages
celebrate the bric-a-brac of the one rather than the
masterpieces of the other. The stanzas here garnered
into one sheaf sing of books as books, of
books valuable and valued for their perfection of
type and page and printing,&mdash;for their beauty and
for their rarity,&mdash;or for their association with some
famous man or woman of the storied past</p>

<p>Two centuries and a half ago Drummond of Hawthornden
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
prefixed to the 'Varieties' of his friend
Persons a braggart distich:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">This book a world is; here, if errors be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The like, nay worse, in the great world we see.</span>
</div></div>

<p>The present collection of varieties in verse has little
or naught to do with the great world and its errors:
it has to do chiefly, not to say wholly, with the world
of the Bookmen&mdash;the little world of the Book-lover,
the Bibliophile, the Bibliomaniac&mdash;a mad world, my
masters, in which there are to be found not a few
poets who cherish old wine and old wood, old
friends and old books, and who believe that old
books are the best of old friends.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Books, books again, and books once more!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These are our theme, which some miscall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mere madness, setting little store<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By copies either short or tall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But you, O slaves of shelf and stall!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We rather write for you that hold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Patched folios dear, and prize "the small<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rare volume, black with burnished gold."</span>
</div></div>

<p>as Mr. Austin Dobson sang on the threshold of Mr.
Lang's delightfully discursive little book about the
'Library.'</p>

<p>The editor has much pleasure in thanking the
poets who have allowed him to reprint their poems
in these pages; and he acknowledges a double debt
of gratitude to the friends who have written poems
expressly for this collection. Encouraged by their
support, and remembering that he is not a contributor
to his own pages, the editor ventures to conclude
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
his harmless necessary catalogue of the things contained
and not contained within these covers, by
quoting Herrick's address to his Book:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Be bold, my Book, nor be abash'd, or fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cutting thumb-nail, or the brow severe;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But by the muses swear, all here is good,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If but well read, or ill read, understood.</span>

<h3>MY SHAKSPERE.</h3>

</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">With bevelled binding, with uncut edge,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With broad white margin and gilded top,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fit for my library's choicest ledge,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Fresh from the bindery, smelling of shop,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In tinted cloth, with a strange design&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Buskin and scroll-work and mask and crown,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And an arabesque legend tumbling down&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"The Works of Shakspere" were never so fine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fresh from the shop! I turn the page&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Its "ample margin" is wide and fair&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Its type is chosen with daintiest care;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">There's a "New French Elzevir" strutting there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That would shame its prototypic age.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fresh from the shop! O Shakspere mine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I've half a notion you're much too fine!</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There's an ancient volume that I recall,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In foxy leather much chafed and worn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its back is broken by many a fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The stitches are loose and the leaves are torn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gone is the bastard-title, next<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To the title-page scribbled with owners' names,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That in straggling old-style type proclaims<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
<span class="i0">That the work is from the corrected text<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Left by the late Geo. Steevens, Esquire.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">The broad sky burns like a great blue fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the Lake shines blue as shimmering steel,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And it cuts the horizon like a blade&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But behind the poplar's a strip of shade&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The great tall Lombardy on the lawn.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lying there in the grass, I feel<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The wind that blows from the Canada shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And in cool, sweet puffs comes stealing o'er,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Fresh as any October dawn.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I lie on my breast in the grass, my feet<br /></span>

<span class="i2">The old brown Shakspere in front of me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And big are my eyes, and my heart's a-beat;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And my whole soul's lost&mdash;in what?&mdash;who knows?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perdita's charms or Perdita's woes&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perdita fairy-like, fair and sweet.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Is any one jealous, I wonder, now,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of my love for Perdita? For I vow<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I loved her well. And who can say<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That life would be quite the same life to-day&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That Love would mean so much, if she<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Had not taught me its A B C?</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The Grandmother, thin and bent and old,<br /></span>

<span class="i4">Ah me! for her and for me the hours<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Go by, and for her the smell of earth&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for me the breeze and a far love's birth,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the sun and the sky and all the things<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That a boy's heart hopes and a poet sings.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Fresh from the shop! O Shakspere mine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It wasn't the binding made you divine!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I knew you first in a foxy brown,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In the old, old home, where I laid me down,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">In the idle summer afternoons,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With you alone in the odorous grass,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And set your thoughts to the wind's low tunes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And saw your children rise up and pass&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And dreamed and dreamed of the things to be,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Known only, I think, to you and me.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I've hardly a heart for you dressed so fine&mdash;<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A country squire, of greater wealth than wit<br /></span>
<span class="i2">(For fools are often blessed with fortune's smile),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had built a splendid house, and furnished it<br /></span>
<span class="i24">In splendid style.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"One thing is wanting," said a friend; "for, though<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The rooms are fine, the furniture profuse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You lack a library, dear sir, for show,<br /></span>
<span class="i24">If not for use."</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Tis true; but 'zounds!" replied the squire with glee,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"The lumber-room in yonder northern wing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(I wonder I ne'er thought of it) will be<br /></span>
<span class="i24">The very thing.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I'll have it fitted up without delay<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With shelves and presses of the newest mode<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rarest wood, befitting every way<br /></span>
<span class="i24">A squire's abode."</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
<span class="i0">"And when the whole is ready, I'll dispatch<br /></span>
<span class="i2">My coachman&mdash;a most knowing fellow&mdash;down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To buy me, by admeasurement, a batch<br /></span>
<span class="i24">Of books in town."</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But ere the library was half supplied<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With all its pomps of cabinet and shelf,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The booby squire repented him, and cried<br /></span>
<span class="i24">Unto himself:&mdash;</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"This room is much more roomy than I thought;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Ten thousand volumes hardly would suffice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To fill it, and would cost, however bought,<br /></span>
<span class="i24">A plaguy price."</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Now as I only want them for their looks,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">It might, on second thoughts, be just as good,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cost me next to nothing, if the books<br /></span>
<span class="i24">Were made of wood."</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"It shall be so, I'll give the shaven deal<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A coat of paint&mdash;a colorable dress,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To look like calf or vellum, and conceal<br /></span>
<span class="i24">Its nakedness."</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And, gilt and lettered with the author's name,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Whatever is most excellent and rare<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The work was done; the simulated hoards<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of wit and wisdom round the chamber stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In binding some; and some, of course, in <i>boards</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i24">Where all were wood.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">From bulky folios down to slender twelves<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The choicest tomes, in many an even row<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Displayed their lettered backs upon the shelves,<br /></span>
<span class="i24">A goodly show.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">With such a stock as seemingly surpassed<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The best collection ever formed in Spain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What wonder if the owner grew at last<br /></span>
<span class="i24">Supremely vain?</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">What wonder, as he paced from shelf to shelf,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And conned their titles, that the squire began,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Despite his ignorance, to think himself<br /></span>
<span class="i24">A learned man?</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Let every amateur, who merely looks</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>To backs and binding, take the hint, and sell</i><br /></span>

</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When the sad soul, by care and grief oppressed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looks round the world, but looks in vain for rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When every object that appears in view<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Partakes her gloom and seems dejected too;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where shall affliction from itself retire?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where fade away and placidly expire?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alas! we fly to silent scenes in vain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Care blasts the honors of the flowery plain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Care veils in clouds the sun's meridian beam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sighs through the grove, and murmurs in the stream;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For when the soul is laboring in despair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In vain the body breathes a purer air:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No storm-tost sailor sighs for slumbering seas&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He dreads the tempest, but invokes the breeze;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the smooth mirror of the deep resides<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reflected woe, and o'er unruffled tides<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ghost of every former danger glides.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus, in the calms of life, we only see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A steadier image of our misery;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But lively gales and gently clouded skies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Disperse the sad reflections as they rise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And busy thoughts and little cares avail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To ease the mind, when rest and reason fail.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the dull thought, by no designs employed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dwells on the past, or suffered or enjoyed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We bleed anew in every former grief,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And joys departed furnish no relief.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Not Hope herself, with all her flattering art,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can cure this stubborn sickness of the heart:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The soul disdains each comfort she prepares,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And anxious searches for congenial cares;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those lenient cares, which, with our own combined,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By mixed sensations ease th' afflicted mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And steal our grief away, and leave their own behind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A lighter grief! which feeling hearts endure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without regret, nor e'en demand a cure.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But what strange art, what magic can dispose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The troubled mind to change its native woes?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or lead us, willing from ourselves, to see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Others more wretched, more undone than we?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This <span class="smcap">Books</span> can do;&mdash;nor this alone; they give<br /></span>
<span class="i0">New views to life, and teach us how to live;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They soothe the grieved, the stubborn they chastise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fools they admonish and confirm the wise:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their aid they yield to all: they never shun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The man of sorrow, nor the wretch undone:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unlike the hard, the selfish, and the proud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They fly not sullen from the suppliant crowd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor tell to various people various things,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But show to subjects what they show to kings.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come, Child of Care! to make thy soul serene,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Approach the treasures of this tranquil scene;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Survey the dome, and, as the doors unfold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The soul's best cure, in all her cares behold!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where mental wealth the poor in thought may find,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mental physic the diseased in mind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See here the balms that passion's wounds assuage;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See coolers here, that damp the fire of rage;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here alteratives, by slow degrees control<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The chronic habits of the sickly soul;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And round the heart, and o'er the aching head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mild opiates here their sober influence shed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now bid thy soul man's busy scenes exclude,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And view composed this silent multitude:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Silent they are&mdash;but though deprived of sound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here all the living languages abound;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here all that live no more; preserved they lie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In tombs that open to the curious eye.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Blest be the gracious Power, who taught mankind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To stamp a lasting image of the mind!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beasts may convey, and tuneful birds may sing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their mutual feelings, in the opening spring;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Man alone has skill and power to send<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The heart's warm dictates to the distant friend;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis his alone to please, instruct, advise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ages remote, and nations yet to rise.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In sweet repose, when Labor's children sleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Joy forgets to smile and Care to weep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Passion slumbers in the lover's breast,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And Fear and Guilt partake the balm of rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why then denies the studious man to share<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Man's common good, who feels his common care?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Because the hope is his that bids him fly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Night's soft repose, and sleep's mild power defy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That after-ages may repeat his praise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fame's fair meed be his, for length of days.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Delightful prospect! when we leave behind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A worthy offspring of the fruitful mind!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which, born and nursed through many an anxious day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall all our labor, all our care repay.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yet all are not these births of noble kind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not all the children of a vigorous mind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But where the wisest should alone preside,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The weak would rule us, and the blind would guide;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, man's best efforts taste of man, and show<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The poor and troubled source from which they flow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where most he triumphs we his wants perceive,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for his weakness in his wisdom grieve.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But though imperfect all; yet wisdom loves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This seat serene, and virtue's self approves:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here come the grieved, a change of thought to find;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The curious here to feed a craving mind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here the devout their peaceful temple choose;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And here the poet meets his favoring Muse.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With awe, around these silent walks I tread;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These are the lasting mansions of the dead:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"The dead!" methinks a thousand tongues reply;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"These are the tombs of such as cannot die!<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Crowned with eternal fame, they sit sublime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And laugh at all the little strife of time.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Hail, then, immortals! ye who shine above,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each, in his sphere, the literary Jove;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ye, the common people of these skies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A humbler crowd of nameless deities;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whether 't is yours to lead the willing mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through History's mazes, and the turnings find;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or, whether led by Science, ye retire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lost and bewildered in the vast desire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whether the Muse invites you to her bowers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And crowns your placid brows with living flowers!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or godlike Wisdom teaches you to show<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The noblest road to happiness below;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or men and manners prompt the easy page<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To mark the flying follies of the age;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whatever good ye boast, that good impart;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inform the head and rectify the heart.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Lo, all in silence, all in order stand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mighty folios, first a lordly band;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then quartos their well-ordered ranks maintain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And light octavos fill a spacious plain:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See yonder, ranged in more frequented rows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A humbler band of duodecimos;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While undistinguish'd trifles swell the scene,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The last new play and frittered magazine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus 't is in life, where first the proud, the great,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In leagued assembly keep their cumbrous state:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heavy and huge, they fill the world with dread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are much admired, and are but little read:<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The commons next, a middle rank, are found;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Professions fruitful pour their offspring round;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reasoners and wits are next their place allowed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And last, of vulgar tribes a countless crowd.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That weight of wood, with leathern coat o'erlaid;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those ample clasps of solid metal made;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With sceptic queries marks the passing page;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Records of old nor later date are clear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too distant those, and these are placed too near;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There time conceals the objects from our view,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here our own passions and a writer's too:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, in these volumes, see how states arose!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Guarded by virtue from surrounding foes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their virtue lost, and of their triumphs vain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo! how they sunk to slavery again!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Satiate with power, of fame and wealth possessed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A nation grows too glorious to be blest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Conspicuous made, she stands the mark of all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And foes join foes to triumph in her fall.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thus speaks the page that paints ambition's race,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The monarch's pride, his glory, his disgrace;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The headlong course that maddening heroes run,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How soon triumphant, and how soon undone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How slaves, turned tyrants, offer crowns to sale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And each fallen nation's melancholy tale.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Lo! where of late the Book of Martyrs stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old pious tracts, and Bibles bound in wood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There, such the taste of our degenerate age,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stand the profane delusions of the <span class="smcap">Stage</span>:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet virtue owns the <span class="smcap">Tragic Muse</span> a friend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fable her means, morality her end;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For this she rules all passions in their turns,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now the bosom bleeds, and now it burns;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pity with weeping eye surveys her bowl,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her anger swells, her terror chills the soul;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She makes the vile to virtue yield applause,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And own her sceptre while they break her laws;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For vice in others is abhorred of all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And villains triumph when the worthless fall.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Not thus her sister <span class="smcap">Comedy</span> prevails,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who shoots at Folly, for her arrow fails;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Folly, by Dulness armed, eludes the wound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And harmless sees the feathered shafts rebound;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unhurt she stands, applauds the archer's skill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laughs at her malice, and is Folly still.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet well the Muse portrays, in fancied scenes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What pride will stoop to, what profession means;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How formal fools the farce of state applaud;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How caution watches at the lips of fraud;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wordy variance of domestic life;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tyrant husband, the retorting wife;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The snares for innocence, the lie of trade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the smooth tongue's habitual masquerade.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With her the Virtues to obtain a place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each gentle passion, each becoming grace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The social joy in life's securer road,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its easy pleasure, its substantial good;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The happy thought that conscious virtue gives,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all that ought to live, and all that lives.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But who are these? Methinks a noble mien<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And awful grandeur in their form are seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now in disgrace: what though by time is spread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Polluting dust o'er every reverend head;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What though beneath yon gilded tribe they lie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dull observers pass insulting by:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forbid it shame, forbid it decent awe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What seems so grave, should no attention draw!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come, let us then with reverend step advance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And greet&mdash;the ancient worthies of <span class="smcap">Romance</span>.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Hence, ye profane! I feel a former dread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A thousand visions float around my head:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hark! hollow blasts through empty courts resound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shadowy forms with staring eyes stalk round;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See! moats and bridges, walls and castles rise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ghosts, fairies, demons, dance before our eyes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo! magic verse inscribed on golden gate;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bloody hand that beckons on to fate:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And who art thou, thou little page, unfold?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Say, doth thy lord my Claribel withhold?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Go tell him straight, Sir Knight, thou must resign<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The captive queen;&mdash;for Claribel is mine."<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Away he flies; and now for bloody deeds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Black suits of armor, masks, and foaming steeds;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The giant falls; his recreant throat I seize,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from his corselet take the massy keys:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dukes, lords, and knights in long procession move,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Released from bondage with my virgin love:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She comes! she comes! in all the charms of youth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unequalled love, and unsuspected truth!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Ah! happy he who thus, in magic themes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er worlds bewitched, in early rapture dreams,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where wild Enchantment waves her potent wand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Fancy's beauties fill her fairy land;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where doubtful objects strange desires excite,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Fear and Ignorance afford delight.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But lost, for ever lost, to me these joys,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which Reason scatters, and which Time destroys;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too dearly bought: maturer judgment calls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My busied mind from tales and madrigals;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My doughty giants all are slain or fled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all my knights&mdash;blue, green, and yellow&mdash;dead!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No more the midnight fairy tribe I view,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All in the merry moonshine tippling dew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">E'en the last lingering fiction of the brain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The churchyard ghost is now at rest again;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all these wayward wanderings of my youth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fly Reason's power, and shun the light of Truth.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With Fiction then does real joy reside,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And is our reason the delusive guide?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is it then right to dream the sirens sing?<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Or mount enraptured on the dragon's wing?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No; 't is the infant mind, to care unknown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That makes th' imagined paradise its own;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soon as reflections in the bosom rise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Light slumbers vanish from the clouded eyes:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tear and smile, that once together rose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are then divorced; the head and heart are foes:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enchantment bows to Wisdom's serious plan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Pain and Prudence make and mar the man.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">While thus, of power and fancied empire vain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With various thoughts my mind I entertain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While books, my slaves, with tyrant hand I seize,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pleased with the pride that will not let them please,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sudden I find terrific thoughts arise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sympathetic sorrow fills my eyes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, lo! while yet my heart admits the wound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I see the <span class="smcap">Critic</span> army ranged around.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Foes to our race! if ever ye have known<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A father's fears for offspring of your own;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If ever, smiling o'er a lucky line,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye thought the sudden sentiment divine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then paused and doubted, and then, tired of doubt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With rage as sudden dashed the stanza out;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If, after fearing much and pausing long,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye ventured on the world your labored song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from the crusty critics of those days<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Implored the feeble tribute of their praise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remember now the fears that moved you then,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, spite of truth, let mercy guide your pen.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">What vent'rous race are ours! what mighty foes<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Lie waiting all around them to oppose!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What treacherous friends betray them to the fight!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What dangers threaten them:&mdash;yet still they write:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A hapless tribe! to every evil born,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom villains hate, and fools affect to scorn:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strangers they come, amid a world of woe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And taste the largest portion ere they go.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Pensive I spoke, and cast mine eyes around;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The roof, methought, returned a solemn sound;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each column seemed to shake, and clouds, like smoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From dusty piles and ancient volumes broke;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gathering above, like mists condensed they seem,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Exhaled in summer from the rushy stream;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like flowing robes they now appear, and twine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Round the large members of a form divine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His silver beard, that swept his aged breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His piercing eye, that inward light expressed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were seen&mdash;but clouds and darkness veiled the rest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fear chilled my heart: to one of mortal race,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How awful seemed the Genius of the place!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So in Cimmerian shores, Ulysses saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His parent-shade, and shrunk in pious awe;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like him I stood, and wrapped in thought profound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When from the pitying power broke forth a solemn sound:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Care lives with all; no rules, no precepts save<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wise from woe, no fortitude the brave;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grief is to man as certain as the grave:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tempests and storms in life's whole progress rise,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And hope shines dimly through o'erclouded skies.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some drops of comfort on the favored fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But showers of sorrow are the lot of <i>all</i>:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Partial to talents, then, shall Heaven withdraw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Th' afflicting rod, or break the general law?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall he who soars, inspired by loftier views,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Life's little cares and little pains refuse?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall he not rather feel a double share<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of mortal woe, when doubly armed to bear?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Hard is his fate who builds his peace of mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the precarious mercy of mankind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who hopes for wild and visionary things,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mounts o'er unknown seas with vent'rous wings;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But as, of various evils that befall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The human race, some portion goes to all;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To him perhaps the milder lot's assigned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who feels his consolation in his mind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, locked within his bosom, bears about<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A mental charm for every care without.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">E'en in the pangs of each domestic grief,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or health or vigorous hope affords relief;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And every wound the tortured bosom feels,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or virtue bears, or some preserver heals;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some generous friend of ample power possessed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some feeling heart, that bleeds for the distressed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some breast that glows with virtues all divine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some noble <span class="smcap">Rutland</span>, misery's friend and thine.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Nor say, the Muse's song, the Poet's pen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Merit the scorn they meet from little men.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With cautious freedom if the numbers flow,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Not wildly high, nor pitifully low;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If vice alone their honest aims oppose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why so ashamed their friends, so loud their foes?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Happy for men in every age and clime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If all the sons of vision dealt in rhyme.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Go on, then, Son of Vision! still pursue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy airy dreams; the world is dreaming too.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ambition's lofty views, the pomp of state,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pride of wealth, the splendor of the great,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stripped of their mask, their cares and troubles known,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are visions far less happy than thy own:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Go on! and, while the sons of care complain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be wisely gay and innocently vain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While serious souls are by their fears undone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blow sportive bladders in the beamy sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And call them worlds! and bid the greatest show<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More radiant colors in their worlds below:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, as they break, the slaves of care reprove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tell them, Such are all the toys they love.</span>

It may be said that Quintilian recommends margins; but it is
with a view to their being occasionally occupied: Debet vacare etiam
locus, in quo notentur quæ scribentibus solent extra ordinem, id est
ex aliis quam qui sunt in manibus loci, occurrere. Irrumpunt enim optimi
nonnunquam Sensus, quos neque inserere oportet, neque differre
tutum est. 'Instit.' lib. x. c. 3.<br /><br />
